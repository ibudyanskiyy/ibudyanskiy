## Brief Introduction ... ðŸ‘¾

I am an aspiring Internet Technology Professional with a profound interest in technology, networking, and a dedication to solving complex problems. My journey into IT began when I decided to manually build my gaming PC instead of purchasing a pre-built PC. With this decision, I was able to inspect the intricacies of my computer and its functionalities firsthand which sparked a continous curiosity within me to understand technology. I am currently working towards obtaining the Network + certification while expanding my knowledge through completing projects and research.

## Objective 

My journey in Internet Technology has led me to develop a passion for networking and IT as I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join the industry in a Technical Support role.
